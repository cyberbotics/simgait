# simgait.org

This repository hosts the source code of [simgait.org](https://simgait.org).

The SimGait project is a four year project funded by the [SNSF](http://www.snf.ch).
It aims at creating a musculoskeletal model of the human with neural control to model healthy and impaired gait, for example due to cerebral palsy. [simgait.org](https://simgait.org) contains a webservice allowing to run musculoskeletal simulations from the web.

## Setup

[simgait.org](https://simgait.org) runs on a fairly powerful hardware:

- Intel Core i7 950 @ 3.07 GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970

The BIOS was configured to reboot the machine after a power outage.

The following software is installed:

- Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop with `apache2`, `php` and `webots` (from the snap store).

We plan to install [CodeIgniter4](/codeigniter4/codeigniter4/).
